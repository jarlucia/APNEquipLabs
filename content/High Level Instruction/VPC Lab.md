2. Create an Elastic IP
3. Review your new VPC and draw out the complete deployment including:
	* Subnets
	* IGW
	* NAT Gateway
	* Security groups
	* NACL

**Additional challange**

1. Create a Public EC2 instance into the new VPC
	* Use t2.micro and amazon Linux 2 AMI assign network to new VPC
2. Test public access
	* Assign a new Elastic IP to the instance
	* Ensure security group and NACL allow EC2 to communicate
3. Is there another way to achieve public access without an elastic IP?
4. Clean up your account
	* Terminate EC2 instance
	* Release any Elastic IPâ€™s
	* Delete NAT Gateway and the VPC
