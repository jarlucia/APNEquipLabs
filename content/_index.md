Attempt to do the lab using **High Level instructions** instead of the Detailed instructions.<br>
Each high level instructions will include **AWS public documentation** that you could **review** to put things together.<br>
Use the **Detailed Instructions** only if you are desperate or you are completely new to AWS.<br>
**Take time** to **explore** the service your are building during the Lab.<br>
**Ask Question**, we are here to help.
